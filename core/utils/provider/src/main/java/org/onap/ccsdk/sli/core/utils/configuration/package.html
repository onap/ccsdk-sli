  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
    CDP Configuration support is provided by a common framework to load
    and manage configuration properties from multiple sources. The basic
    concept is to load a set of default properties from a known resource
    file located on the class path, and then override these defaults
    with optional settings that can be provided by a user through either
    additional property files or via the command line (as VM arguments).
    The loading of defaults from a resource property file (named <strong>com/att/cdp/default.properties</strong>)
    ensures that values are defined for properties the application needs
    in order to operate.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
    One of these default values that can be set is the name of the
    property file that allows the user to supply settings, as well as
    the path where the file can be found. In general, the default name
    of the property file will be &quot;<strong>cdp.properties</strong>&quot;,
    and the path that will be searched is &quot;<strong>${user.home};etc;../etc</strong>&quot;.
    However, these values can be changed through the use of the
    default.properties resource file. The property that specifies the
    property file name is named <strong>com.att.cdp.bootstrap.file</strong>,
    while the property named <strong>com.att.cdp.bootstrap.path</strong>
    specifies the search path.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
    After the default.properties are loaded, but prior to searching for
    the application configuration file, the configuration factory checks
    for properties <strong>com.att.cdp.bootstrap.path</strong> and <strong>com.att.cdp.bootstrap.file
    </strong>in the System properties object (meaning they were set by the
    command line). If these values are defined in the system properties
    object, they are used. If not, these values are obtained from the
    default properties just loaded. This allows the specification of
    either the file name or path, or both, to be overridden during start
    up by using command-line arguments.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The search path is scanned for the
    first occurrence of the specified property file. The first
    occurrence is loaded and scanning is stopped at that point. The
    configuration factory does not load all occurrences it finds, only
    the first occurrence it finds.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The configuration properties are
    loaded and processed according to a defined precedence order, such
    that properties defined with a higher precedence override the same
    property at a lower precedence. The precedence order is defined as
    follows:</p>
  <h2>Precedence Order</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Default properties are initially loaded into the
      configuration. These default properties are the lowest level
      precedence, and will be overridden by any properties specified at
      higher levels. These are loaded from resources that are packaged
      as part of the various application components. Each component
      (Server, Coordinator, EPM, or CLI) may have different default
      properties. The default properties are loaded from a resource
      named <strong>com/att/cdp/default.properties</strong>. The default
      properties can specify the name of the application property file
      to be used to configure the application, as well as the path to
      search. Additionally, these properties can be supplied via the
      command line to override the default settings if needed.<br /> <br />
    </li>
    <li>The configuration factory allows for the application to
      supply an initial properties object to initialize the
      configuration. This properties object could be loaded or created
      in any way necessary for the application. This is totally up to
      the application to define, if it is needed. If no
      application-specific property object is supplied, this step is
      skipped. If a property object is supplied, it is used to replace
      or set any properties that may have been defined by the defaults.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>The configuration factory will then search for a bootstrap
      file on a bootstrap path. The actual bootstrap file name and path
      can be specified as properties on the command line, or will
      default to a file name of <strong>cdp.properties</strong> and a
      path of <strong>${user.home};etc;../etc</strong>. If desired, the
      user can specify the exact name of the property file to be loaded
      as well as the path using <strong>-Dcom.att.cdp.bootstrap.file=&lt;filename&gt;</strong>
      and <strong>-Dcom.att.cdp.bootstrap.path=&lt;path&gt;</strong>.
      These properties are set to default values by the default
      properties loaded in step #1 above. The first occurrence of a
      property file is the file loaded and used. Any other occurrences
      are not processed.<br /> <br />
    </li>
    <li>The System properties are then merged into the
      configuration. This allows the highest level of precedence,
      command-line VM arguments (-D<strong>name=value</strong>) to be
      merged into the configuration property object. These settings
      override all lower level settings of the same name, as well as
      merge all system properties into the configuration object.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
    The configuration support allows for variables to be inserted into
    any property that is defined. Variables are named using the format <strong>${name}</strong>,
    where the &quot;name&quot; is the name of a property that is defined
    in the configuration, or a system property (such as <strong>user.home</strong>).
    Variables can nest, such that a variable can be replaced with
    another variable, which is then reevaluated to obtain the value.
    This allows for indirection as well as variable substitution, if
    needed.
  </p>
  <h2>Using the Configuration Support</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
    The configuration support was designed to be easy to use. The
    configuration implementation is abstracted away from the application
    so that it could be changed easily in the future if needed, or if we
    needed to load different implementations for different reasons. This
    means that the application always accesses the configuration through
    an interface, named <strong>Configuration</strong>. The
    implementation of that configuration interface is obtained by a
    static method on the <strong>ConfigurationFactory</strong> class.
    The configuration factory will both create the configuration if not
    already created on the first access, as well as return the current
    configuration if already created. Additionally, the
    ConfigurationFactory provides mechanisms to recreate the
    configuration after the application is initialized should the need
    arise to update its configuration.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">An example of the code needed to
    obtain access to the configuration is:</p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Configuration config = ConfigurationFactory.getConfiguration();</pre>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Please refer to the javadoc or the
    source code in cdp-common for other ways that the configuration and
    configuration factory can be used.</p>
  <h2>Reloading Properties</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The configuration support allows
    for properties to be re-loaded and re-evaluated after the
    application is running. This is designed to allow a configuration to
    be refreshed should the need arise. This could allow on-demand
    refresh (via a command, for example), or automatically based on
    sensing a change in the configuration file.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
    When the <strong>ConfigurationFactory</strong> method <strong>getConfiguration(Propert</strong><strong>ies)</strong>
    is called, the current configuration is cleared and rebuilt using
    the process defined above. The supplied property object is used in
    step #2 of the process. While the properties are being re-built, no
    access to the properties are allowed. Any attempt to access
    properties while the re-build operation is in effect will block the
    caller until completed. This is accomplished using read and write
    shared locks.
